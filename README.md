# Task
Blockchain task


Task1:

Task 1 is running perfectly!

Task2:
1. As the string returned from function in task1: returns correct value
we need to execute transferFrom(master, msg.sender, amount(acc. to length))
As, only master account has tokens minted.
by delegate address we mean: msg.sender would be delegate addresses in this call: transferFrom(master, msg.sender, amount(acc. to length))
but the transferFrom is called by the contract.
